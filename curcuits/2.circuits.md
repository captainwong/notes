# Principles of Electric Circuits

## L02 Some concepts on circuits

### 1. Composition

- Source (generator, pv cell, mic, ...)
- Load (motor, speaker, screen, ...)
- Energy or/and signal processing circuits (transformer, filter, amplifire, ...)
- Switch and line (circuits board, transmission line)

### 2. How to regard circuits?

#### by Load 负载

- Resistive 阻性电路: If the load of circuits only consists of resistors
- Dynamic 动态电路: If the circuit contains capacitors(and/or inductors)

for Dynamic Load:

- Transient 暂态分析: If we're interested in the change of voltages and currents in the transient process of the dynamic circuits
- Steady state 稳态分析：If we're interested in the value before and after the changing process

#### by Source

- dc
- ac
  - sine
  - periodical
